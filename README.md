This is a simple demonstration website using Node.js, Express, and Mongodb.  The site pulls data from the Pokemon API for the pokemon Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle.  It then displays 
the name, types, and stats of the specified pokemon when it is selected by the user along with a picture.  The user can select their pokemon through the use of a toolbar or through a shifting
carousel.  In addition, the data of the pokemon are then entered into mongodb with each entry having its own id number.
